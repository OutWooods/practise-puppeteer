# Practise Puppeteer/Jest

I decided to try out using Puppeteer and Jest for my bowling challenge project and found this quite tricky. So to keep it simple, I decided to make a sandbox project to try and work out how to use this pair.

Originally I decided to just keep this on my local machine. But actually, on reflection, I thought it was a 
good idea to push it so if anyone wanted to see something really basic examples with Testing and puppeteer it may be useful. 
After a bit of digging in the docs there some great resources provided by google on it. There seem to be loads of different ways of 
using puppeteer (not just for testing). 

Its very much a learning project, and particularly for testing out all the great features in puppeteer - so I can dip in and out.
So the websites rather basic and may change rather alot...

If you want to try out puppeteer there's some really excellent documentation and example work. 

## Resources I found helpful
This is the [main example](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-use-puppeteer-as-a-acceptance-test-f301982f2457) I followed. Its nice, simple and clear. Well explained. You can see remnants of the code in my commit history

There is a tonne of [examples of Puppeteer](https://github.com/checkly/puppeteer-examples) (including using both with Jest and Mocha).
